                        <p>Prototype web design is the process of creating an early model or representation of a website to visualize and test its structure, functionality, and aesthetics before full-scale development begins. It serves as a preliminary version that helps designers, developers, and stakeholders understand and refine the website's layout, user interface, and user experience.</p>
